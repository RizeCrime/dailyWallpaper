# dailyWallpaper

Checks r/wallpaper for the today's top wallpaper, then downloads it and sets it as wallpaper.
I recommend setting it to autorun every day or at boot to get a fresh wallpaper every day.

Currently only works for Linux/KDE.

The Code to set the downloaded image as wallpaper comes from: https://github.com/pashazz/ksetwallpaper
